Now it is very hard to show proof of this, as A-Chassis Tuning is simply editing a module script with the values that suit the respective vehicle.
However, I have worked on a variety of different tunes primarily for the Roblox experience "Maple County." Within that experience majority of vehicles 
have been re-tuned by me, with the exception of a few that weren't complete before my resignation. For anyone interested, you can join the experience 
and try out the starter pickup truck, or if you're an experienced player, the 2021 Camaro, 2015 Mustang, or 2020 Dodge Charger Hellcat.

For those of you viewing my website from Mountain Interactive, I also have experience doing car tunes for that group! I was responsible for tuning all 
vehicles for the now-defunct Los Angeles project. It's a shame I can't guide you to preview my work since the project is defunct, however current and former 
developers in the Mountain Interactive group can vouch for my work that was performed for them.
