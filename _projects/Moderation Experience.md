I have been moderating online for a few years, but my most recent experience has been with the Roblox group "Central Roleplay Community." I won't get into full detail,
as you can find more in the "About" section of my website, however I became a moderator in January of 2024 and resigned on November 13th, 2024.

Additionally, I was the director of the staff team in Mountain Interactive for a couple months in 2025 before assuming the role 'Chief Operating Officer.' During my time as the director of staff, 
I was responsible for ensuring the moderation team was fair, civil, and professional throughout all of their daily responsibilities.
