This post will be explaining why I stepped down from the Central Roleplay Community faculty team.

First off, I would like to thank Luke, Wisp, and CrxzyCookiie for giving me the opportunity to work with and for the CRPC faculty team, and for giving me the opportunity to make CRPC a better place. 
I joined this community awhile ago, and since then I have worked my way up in the community and became a prominent member in the Official Whitelisted server. 
This gave me the opportunity to show CRPC administrators my skillsets and how I would perform if they were to hire me for the CRPC faculty team. 
In July of last year, I went on a 6 month long hiatus, and upon announcing this, CrxzyCookiie reached out to me to tell me if I was still interested upon my return, I could join the CRPC faculty team. 
This was shocking to me, I did not expect that message at all, but I am very thankful I got it. When I returned, I took that offer, and began my trial period as a CRPC moderator. 
After that, I moved up to an official CRPC moderator, and began my career with the Central Roleplay Community faculty team. 
I'd be lying if I said it was all sunshine and rainbows from there, because it was not. There were a lot of things that happened that lead up to this point, in and out of CRPC. 
I would just like to thank everyone who has stuck by my side and has been there for me throughout my career. Without some of the other members of the community, I would not be where I am today. 
It was a hard decision to make, but ultimately it was the best course of action I could take under the circumstances. 
So once again, thank you to CRPC administration, CRPC faculty, and to all the community members. This journey has been awesome, and I wish everyone the best in their future endeavors. 
Always keep your heads up, and push to achieve what you want to achieve. It has been a pleasure working alongside my fellow moderators and administration, and working for the CRPC community.

Do great things!
