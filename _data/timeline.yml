  description: The Central Roleplay Community is a studio group on the gaming platform Roblox,
               and they manage several experiences including the now-popular Maple County and Leon County.
               I, fraudwrd, started out as a tester back in mid-2023 with the Central Roleplay Community,
               and eventually moved up to contributor as I began re-tuning the vehicles inside their experience Maple County.
               I then went on a hiatus from July to December, and came back assuming the position of a Moderator,
               which I still currently retain.
