  from: 2023
  to: 2024
  description: The Central Roleplay Community is a studio group on the gaming platform Roblox,
               and they manage several experiences including the now-popular Maple County and Leon County.
               I, fraudwrd, started out as a tester back in mid-2023 with the Central Roleplay Community,
               and eventually moved up to contributor as I began re-tuning the vehicles inside their experience Maple County.
               I then went on a hiatus from July to December of 2023, and came back assuming the position of a Moderator,
               which I still currently retain.

- title: Central Roleplay Community (Whitelisted)
  from: 2023
  to: Present
  description: As a subsidiary of the Central Roleplay Community, the Central Roleplay Community Official Whitelisted server is the sub-community dedicated to professional roleplay.
               Beginning my career in 2023 as a moderator, I worked my way up to administration after helping maintain the whitelisted server.
               Fast forward to 2024 after my 6 month long hiatus in 2023, I obtained the position of Director to help reform the whitelisted server.
